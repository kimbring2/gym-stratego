# Introduction
An OpenAI Gym for the Python implementaion of the [Stratego board game](https://github.com/JeroenKools/gpfj) to benchmark Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Thank you for the [JeroenKools](https://github.com/JeroenKools).

The DeepMind uses the Stratego game as enviroment at the paper titled [Mastering Stratego, the classic game of imperfect information](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/mastering-stratego-the-classic-game-of-imperfect-information). At this paper, they used the algorithm called DeepNash to find the Nash equilibrium when training the agent using the Deep Reinforment Learning.

# Install
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kimbring2/gym-stratego
$ cd gym-stratego
$ pip install -e .
```

Additionally, you need to install the ```Tkinter``` for your Python. Below is an example of the Python 3.9 version.
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3.9-tk
```

# Environment test code
After installing, please run the [environment test code](https://github.com/kimbring2/gym-stratego/blob/main/examples/stratego_env_test.py). There are two options you can choose, enemy_ai and human_play.

For example, you can play with the built-in AI using the command below.

```
python stratego_env_test.py --enemy_ai True --human_play True
```

# Agent train code
First, I trained the agent on the [built-in AIâ€‹](https://github.com/kimbring2/gym-stratego/tree/main/gym_stratego/envs/brains) in the original code.
